          <h2>How to get started with BudgetEase ?</h2>
          <p>Welcome to this first step in using this tool we have created for you. <br>
            Whether you came here because your budget went out of control, or you think our method could make your current budgeting easier, we are happy to know you’re here to give it a try,
            <br><br>
            The rules of our tool are simple: 
            <br>
            </p>

            <div class="explanation-point">
              <img src="" alt="1">
              <h3>
                ASSIGN
              </h3>
              <p>The first time, and once a month, choose the amount of money that you wish to assign to your different spending categories based on the money that is available to you. To help you in the process of decing, you can read our 10 min article that describes the best strategy we have found out there. </p>

              <h3>
                INPUT
              </h3>
              <p>Right after a transaction, at the end of the day or the end of the week, take a few minutes to enter the transactions that you have made.</p>
              <h3>
                BE FLEXIBLE
              </h3>
              <p>If you reach the end of the availabe amount of money for a certain category, that’s not great news. But it’s ok, with this tool, you have three options to remedy the situation: take the amount needed from a category that still seems to have enough for the end of the month OR take from the surplus of money that you hadn’t assigned yet OR maybe just restrain if you can for this</p>
              <h3>
                REVIEW & ADAPT
              </h3>
              <p>At the end of the month, we will send you a simple report. There you will find the categories in which you have overspent, the ones where you have some surplus, and (hopefully as rarely as possible), if you have spent some money you did not want to spend. After each of this report we will ask you if you wish to modify the current share of money for the month.
                And that’s it. Gradually month after month, you should have both a more intuitive way to follow your spendings (with our bucket system) and a better understanding of the ways you spend your money in the long term.  </p>
